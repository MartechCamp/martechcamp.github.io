  <h1>Martech Camp</h1>
  <h2>Why does this even exist?</h2>
  <p>The truth is that I want to give back to a community that has given me so much. Being a digital marketer is a great career, and I believe it has a lot of benefits. I want you to enjoy the same benefits, I enjoy. </p>
  <h2>The hard part of learning Digital Marketing</h2>
  <p>If you're just coming up, it's really hard to learn this craft. There are a few reasons for this:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>You can't get your hands on the tools needed to acquire the job in the first place</li>
    <li>Knowledge only seems to come from vendors who have a not-so-hidden agenda</li>
    <li>Technical topics aren't explained in plain English</li>
    <li>Lots of blog spam</li>
  </ul>
  <p>My goal with this site is to eliminate all of these obstacles to your success.</p>
  <h2>I have no agenda</h2>
  <p>This site is 100% free. I will not monetize the content on this website. My plan is to provide an ebook version of the content on this site, which, if you so choose, could pay for. If you want a free copy, I'll happily give it to you, as well!</p>
  <p>I am doing this because I want to give back!</p>
<h2>Why I'm opinionated</h2>
<p>You can easily find someone trying to thread a needle and give you balanced advice. I am not. I'm telling you what's worked for me, and not trying to be everything to everyone. You should absolutely consult other sources.</p>
<p>I think it's important to have an opinion, to be the person in the room thinking super critically about what we're doing. If you don't like my recommendations, good! You should seek out a second opinion. I'm not creating this content as SEO fodder. It's a passion project and as much an expression of my particular style.</p>
<p>I am showing you how I use digital marketing to solve certain problems.</p>
